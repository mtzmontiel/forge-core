GIT-CHECKOUT(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
git-checkout - checks out a local Git branch


SYNOPSIS
--------
*git-checkout* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The git-checkout(1) command switches to a given local branch 'BRANCH-NAME'. If 
specified by the 'CREATE' option, the command will try to create the branch 
by also configuring the 'TRACKING-MODE'. This should be run in the context of
an existing project, where GIT was set up (either by git-setup(1) or by 
git-clone(1)).


OPTIONS
-------
*-branchName*=['BRANCH-NAME']::
    The name of the branch which will be checked out. The default value is 
    'master'.
*-create*=['CREATE']::
    If set to 'true' the command will try to create a branch with name 
    'BRANCH-NAME'. It will fail if a branch with the given name exists or if 
    it is not valid name.
*-trackingMode*=['TRACKING-MODE']::
    In case of a newly created branch, this option specifies how it will track
    its upstream. The possible options are 'TRACK', 'NOTRACK' and 
    'SET_UPSTREAM'. The default value is 'SET_UPSTREAM'.
*-force*=['FORCE']::
    If set to 'true' and the 'BRANCH-NAME' already exists, the start-point of 
    an existing branch will be set to a new start-point. If 'false', the 
    existing branch will not be changed. In case of creating a new brach, the
    'true' value will force the create, no matter if the branch exists. The
    default value is 'false'.
